# .net-core-api-example
This is an example of how .NET Core can be easily used with SQLite for POCs or other things. I personally think this kind of stuff very usefull.
I just created the "create method" and works fine. Feel free to fork and use for studies, like updating, deleting or even make relationships between entities.
I'll do it my self with time.
Hope this reach someone who can be helped.
