# .net-core-api-example
This is an example of how .NET Core can be easily used with SQLite for POCs (Proof of concept) or other things. I personally think this kind of stuff very usefull.
I just created the "create method" and it works fine. Feel free to fork and use for studies, like updating, deleting or even make relationships between entities.
I'll do it my self with time and will updated it.
Hope this reach someone who can be helped.
The database is code first based.
It's a simple sqlite generated with ef migrations.
It makes possible to test things and scenarios with N entities without the need to install a "database server" such MSSqlServer or even MySQL.
Of course it's for POCs (Proof of concept) only.
Once valid, then you should migrate to a server like the other (MSSQLServer, Oracle, etc) or even in cloud based solutions.
